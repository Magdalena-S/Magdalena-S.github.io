## Hi!

My name is Magdalena and I'm currently studying at the Linneaus University in Kalmar, Sweden. 
This webpage is made as an assignment for the course 1dv022, where I'm learning about client-based web programming. 

### But what about me?

This is actually my second time around the Linneaus University. 
I have a Bachelor's degree of Sience in Social Work, and I worked in that field for almost 7 years 
before I decided to explore my computer interests and say hello to the school bench again. 
Well, maybe not the school bench as I'm studying as a distance-student, but you get the point.

In addition to completely changing my career orientation, I also enjoy playing video games. And to cook. And traveling. And my cats. I love my cats.
